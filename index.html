        I worked on a couple projects as part of the GKE Kubernetes Storage Lifecycle team. My project focused on improving the performance of the storage stack to support large multi-thousand node clusters. I worked on parallelizing and ensuring idempotency in GCP Container Storage Interface Persistent Disk Driver operations, scale test both in-tree and CSI storage plugins, and mitigating known scaling bottlenecks.

  <!--Research-->
  <div class="subsubtitle">Research</div>
  <div class="text">
    I currently research in the UC Berkeley Network Systems laboratory. My work deal mainly with distributed systems, its optimization,
    and providing system guarantees. My research is focused on practical solutions to real world problems in distributed systems. I've been involved
    in research since I was a freshman in undergrad, and I have worked on all aspects of research as you would expect from a graduate student.
    Most of my work is implemented in Go, Python, and Javascript, although I have additionally used C and Ruby.
    Service level knowledge include Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS/GCP.
  </div>
  <div class="supersubtitle">Resource Allocation Optimization in Distributed Systems (AutoTune)</div>
  <div class="text">
    The AutoTune project aims to reduce the cost to deploy a distributed system by minimizing
    resource allocation while improving performance. It automatically cuts down on overprovisioned
    resources and alleviates underprovisioned ones, then packing the system into the minimum number of nodes required.
    AutoTune is implemented in Python and uses microservice-resource stressing to determine under and over provisioned resources.
    A pre-print paper for this project is available upon request.
  </div>
  <div class="supersubtitle">Security and Privacy Policies via Lineage Tracing</div>
  <div class="text">
    This ongoing project aims to build a system for globally deploying and
    enforcing data based policies at the microservice level with-out intrusive application code level modifications. We hope
    that it can be used by compliance experts with minimal software engineering experience to easily program complex
    privacy and security policies into existing infrastructure.
    This is accomplished by tracking pieces of data, called tuples, at the cluster level using data lineage and then blocking the
    flow of data between microservices if it does not pass all the relevant policies. A very rough whitepaper is available upon request.
  </div>
  <div class="supersubtitle">Verified Triggers</div>
  <div class="text">
    Verified Triggers was an exploratory project to safely declare and enforce cluster wise policies in Kubernetes.
    Operators running a distributed system can enforce properties (i.e. fault tolerance of a distributed database) by
    specifying a set of event driven triggers that perform an action (i.e. move worker if more than 50% of workers on same machine)
    when activated. When systems become complex, these triggers may have unintended and troublesome effects when used together, most notably
    non-convergence or unbounded growth.
